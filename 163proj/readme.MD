# Computational Geometry Final Project

This is a project that I completed for one of my classes, Computational Geometry, in the fall semester of 2014. I chose to focus on Chan's Algorithm, which computes the convex hull of a set of points. You can read his paper <a href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~suri/cs235/ChanCH.pdf">here</a> for more details. I really liked this algorithm because it was very straightforward having already learned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm">Jarvis March</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan">Graham Scan</a> algorithms. We had also previously studied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkpatrickâ€“Seidel_algorithm">Kirkpatrick-Seidel Algorithm and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickhull">Quickhull Algorithm, which made Chan's look much better in comparison! 

I was new to Processing when I completed this assignement, so there are some things that I would like to update in the future to make the visualization somewhat clearer.
